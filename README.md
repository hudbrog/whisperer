Whisperer is a Windows desktop application written in C# and built on the .NET framework. It uses the OpenAI API to transcribe audio and simulate typing the transcribed text. The application is designed to run in the background and can be controlled using a global hotkey.

## Built with AI

Whisperer is primarily built using AI models. I've used OpenAI ChatGPT and Phind to write 99% of the code. I haven't written anything for Windows or using .NET for over 20 years, so if you think that this application is ugly or architecturally wrong, I have nothing to do with that. It's all AI.


## Features

Audio recording: Whisperer can record audio when a global hotkey is pressed.
Audio transcription: The recorded audio is sent to the OpenAI API for transcription.
Text simulation: The transcribed text is then simulated as if it were being typed by the user.
Configuration: The application includes a configuration form where users can set their API key and other settings.
